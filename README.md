# Full Stack Developer Consulting Challenge

Welcome to the Full Stack Developer Consulting Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your problem-solving skills, ability to understand existing codebases, and proficiency in working with modern development technologies.

## Challenge Overview

You will be provided with a Node.js API sample project built using LoopBack. However, you will not be able to run the project locally with the current setup, as only certain files will be provided. Your task is to analyze the provided project, identify outdated libraries and scripts by examining the `package.json` file, and understand the structure and functionality of the project by exploring the files located in the `server` and `common` directories.

After analyzing the existing project, your main objective is to:

- Make quick code updates/upgrades to improve the project.

## Instructions

1. **Review Provided Files**: Begin by examining the files provided in the project directory. This includes the `package.json` file, as well as files located in the `server` and `common` directories.

2. **Identify Outdated Libraries**: Check the `package.json` file for any outdated libraries or scripts being used in the project. Note down these dependencies and consider how updating them might affect the project.

3. **Make Quick Code Updates/Upgrades**: Enhance the project by implementing a series of code updates. This may include fixing bugs, optimizing code, updating dependencies, or refactoring code for better maintainability. Prioritize improvements for the `server.js` file, and/or the two models located in the `/common/models/` directory.

4. **Document Changes**: Provide documentation outlining the changes you made, including any updates to the code, dependencies, or configuration files.

## Additional Notes

- This is a quick task intended to be completed within a maximum of 1 hour.
- Focus on making immediate improvements to the existing codebase.
- Consider future plans to upgrade to the latest version of LoopBack or migrate to a similar technology.
- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the challenge.
- Good luck, and we look forward to your code review and improvements!
